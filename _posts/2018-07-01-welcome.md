## English  
Hi there ~  
This is Yaakov Azat & welcome to [my blog](https://yaakovazat.com/blog) ~

I am a Research Fellow and CS Master degree student in al-Farabi Kazakh National University.    
I am an academic with a foolishly wide range of interests: physics, space, sound, music, schools, education, designr, politics, participation, media, audio, art, allergies. Where possible, I like to experiment with different media in my work.

I'm an entrepreneur and researcher who has launched two successful startups, Biryol Inc and QazKaz Org. I'm here to share my tips, tricks, and hacks I've learned along the way.

You may want to [see the about page for more concrete information](https://yaakovazat/blog/about) or [see my CV online](https://yaakovazat/CV/) next. Please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/yaakovazat/blog/issues) or [send me email](mailto:yaakovazat@gmail.com) if you have any questions.
